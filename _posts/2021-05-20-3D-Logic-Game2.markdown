As my bachelor thesis, I did a 3D logic game in Unity.
The game's main concept is mirroring of the worlds, where the player must move certain things or somehow interact with the environment to open the door to the next room.

I created 3 levels with 29 puzzle rooms. All models were created in Blender, and the implementation was done in C# in Unity. 
The game design document with a little bit more information about the game is part of the bachelor thesis (specifically the Game Design Document chapter). 
Here is the pdf version of the thesis: 

<object data="https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/94656/F3-BP-2021-Veverkova-Lucie-Bachelor_thesis_veverlu4.pdf?sequence=-1&isAllowed=y" width="100%" height="1080px" type='application/pdf'></object>

The project can be downloaded on this page: [Dspace](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/94656).

The project with the code is zipped and splitted in the PRILOHA files. To open the project, downloading and extracting all PRILOHA files is necessary. C# files are in Assets/Scripts folder. Models can be found in Assets/Models folder. 
To try out the game in the project, Unity and Blender has to be downloaded on the computer.

I uploaded short gameplay to 
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=VPyuXbMLG64).
