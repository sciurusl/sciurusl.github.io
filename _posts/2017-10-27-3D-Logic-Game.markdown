As my bachelor thesis, I did a 3D logic game in Unity.
The game's main concept is mirroring of the worlds, where the player must move certain things or somehow interact with the environment to open the door to the next room.

I created 3 levels with 29 puzzle rooms. All models were created in Blender, and the implementation was done in C# in Unity. The game design document with a little bit more information  is part of the bachelor thesis (specifically Game Design Document chapter), which can be found on this website: https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/94656

PLNY_TEXT is the pdf version of the thesis. The project with the code is zipped and shattered across the PRILOHA files. To open the project, downloading and extracting all PRILOHA files is necessary. C# files are in Assets/Scripts folder. Models can be found in Assets/Models folder. To try out the game, Unity has to be downloaded on the computer. I uploaded short gameplay to Youtube: 3D Logic Game, Lucie Veverkova - YouTube.
