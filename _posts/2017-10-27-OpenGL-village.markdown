For a student project, I created a small village scene in OpenGL and C++, where the player could
somehow interact with the environment. 

The goal of this project was to create a scene with a village, where the player can move using WASD, 
cut trees by clicking on them, collect wood and light a fire by clicking on one of the rocks.
The player can turn on a flashlight, a fog, change camera and open a menu. The time changes, which is visualized by 
darkening and dawning of the sky.
