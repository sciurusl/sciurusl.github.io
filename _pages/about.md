My name is Lucie Veverkov√°. I'm a student of Czech Technical University in Prague,
where I study Computer Graphics as major program specialization and Software Engineering as minor specialization.

I gained my bachelor's degree at the same university in June 2021 from Computer Games and Graphics specialization.

### About me
I am a huge animal lover. I have two perfect cats who make me smile everyday. 
Some of my hobbies are singing, painting, (I would say also running, but I'd be lying), reading, playing video games.

### About my studies

During my education, I gained valuable experience in coding in many different languages such as
Java, C#, C, C++, Python, and Matlab. I improved my critical thinking, gained the ability to work in teams,
solve problems, and gained knowledge in data structures and algorithms. I can work with SQL
databases and REST projects. My specialization was also very mathematically based, which, among
other things, led to the development of logical thinking. I am able to learn quickly, which means I can
easily adapt to a new environment.

I gained knowledge of programming graphics, creating 2D and 3D graphic content in Blender, and implementation of user interfaces during my studies. I learned
OpenGL basics. For one of many student projects, I created a small village scene in OpenGL + C++, where the
player could move, change the camera, and interact with the environment. The topic of my
bachelor's thesis was creating a 3D logic game in Unity, which means I am familiar with this engine.
