My name is Lucie Veverkov√°. I am a recent graduate from Czech Technical University in Prague, holding both a Bachelor's degree in
Computer Graphics and Games and a Master's degree in Computer Graphics. My Master's thesis, titled "Using
Tight Bounding Volume for Bounding Volume Hierarchies", focused on efficiently building data structures
representing a 3D scene for optimised rendering using GPU programming with CUDA and C++.

### About my studies

During my education, I gained valuable experience in coding in many different languages such as
Java, C#, C, C++, Python, and Matlab. I improved my critical thinking, gained the ability to work in teams,
solve problems, and gained knowledge in data structures and algorithms. I can work with SQL
databases and REST projects. My specialization was also very mathematically based.

I gained knowledge of programming graphics, creating 2D and 3D graphic content in Blender, and implementation of user interfaces during my studies. I learned
OpenGL basics. For one of many student projects, I created a small village scene in OpenGL and C++, where the
player could move, change the camera, and interact with the environment. The topic of my
bachelor's thesis was creating a 3D logic game in Unity.

During my Master's studies, I learned the basics of animation, including cloth, facial, and fluid animation, as well as kinematics and crowd simulation. I also gained experience in scene rendering using low-level programming, utilizing techniques such as rasterization, ray tracing, path tracing, and photon mapping. Additionally, I studied various data structures used in 3D graphics and the usage of advanced algorithms.

Between August 2023 and January 2024, I participated in the Erasmus study abroad program at Uppsala University in Sweden. During this time, I gained valuable skills, particularly in cross-cultural communication and team collaboration, as the courses emphasized group-based projects. The field of study was Data Science with focus on basics of Artifical Intelligence and the use of Machine Learning in Python. Other courses included data in ethics and law and Swedish.

### Work experience

Since February 2022, I have been working as a Junior Software Engineer at Oracle NetSuite, specializing in Java development. Working on high-bussiness impact product requires precision, speed, and effective communication with project managers, technical support, and other teams from all around the world. In this role, I have developed strong debugging skills and am comfortable navigating complex legacy codebases to deliver efficient solutions. Additionally, I have contributed to improving code maintainability by implementing robust test coverage and refactoring critical components.
